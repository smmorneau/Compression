Summary:

A Java program that compresses and uncompresses files using Huffman coding.


Usage: 

java Huffman (-c|-u) [-v] [-f]  infile outfile
where:
(-c|-u) stands for either "-c" (for compress), or "-u"(for uncompress)
[-v] stands for an optional "-v" flag (for verbose)
[-f] stands for an optional "-f" flag, that forces compression even if the compressed file will be larger than the original file
infile is the input file
outfile is the output file


Verbose Output:

If a file is compressed with the "-v" option, the following is printed to standard output:
- The frequency of each character in the input file (print the ASCII values of the characters, instead of the characters themselves, to make this more readable for binary files)
- The Huffman tree (see class notes on printing trees for pointers on how this can be done)
- The Huffman codes for each character that has a code (characters which do not appear in the input file will not have codes.  Again, print the ASCII values of characters instead of the characters themselves)

If a file is uncompressed with the "-v" option, the following is printed to standard output:
- The Huffman tree
